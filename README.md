# pidp11-2.11bsd

Using the historical Unix 2.11 BSD operating system on the pidp-11

The [pidp11](http://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11) is a replica of the
historical [PDP-11](http://pdp-11.nl), using a Raspberry Pi and the emulator
[simh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH). Many thanks to Oscar Vermeulen
for this very interesting kit.

One of the available historical Unix systems included is [2.11 BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).

In this repository you can find some short tutorials to get started with 2.11 BSD.

Below is a picture of using
[cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)
(installation instructions below) with PiDP-11.

**Using your favorite editor on your laptop**

If you do not like working with vi, there are alternatives. If you access your
system from a laptop, and have networking set up on 2.11 BSD, you can use
FileZilla on your laptop (Windows, OSX, Linux or Raspbian) to transfer and edit
files. This allows using your favorite editor.
