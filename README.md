# pidp11-2.11bsd

Using the historical Unix 2.11BSC operating system on the pidp-11

The [pidp11](http://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11) is a replica of the
historical [PDP-11](http://pdp-11.nl), using a Raspberry Pi and the emulator
[simh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH). Many thanks to Oscar Vermeulen
for this very interesting kit.

One of the available historical Unix systems included is [2.11BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution).

In this repository you can find some short tutorials to get started with 2.11 BSD.

Below is a picture of using
[cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)
(installation instructions below) with PiDP-11.

**Using your favorite editor on your laptop**

If you do not like working with vi, there are alternatives. If you access your
system from a laptop, and have networking set up on 2.11BSD, you can use
FileZilla on your laptop (Windows, OSX, Linux or Raspbian) to transfer and edit
files. This allows using your favorite editor.
